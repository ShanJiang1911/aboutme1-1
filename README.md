# LAB: 02

## About me, with a guessing game

Teach us more about you! Build out an “About Me” webpage that quizzes the user on fun facts gives the user some basic information about who you are and where you came from. We will build onto this project over the next few labs. Be prepared to refactor your code each day and learn about how a web site incrementally goes from an idea to a deployed site through various iterations of development.

### Reflections and Comments

* Styling CSS from the scratch the first time is a time consuming experience, as you don't even know where to start and propertyies and values to use.  

* Glad I could peek into the instructor Sara's demo written during lecture. Gives me a basic idea. And I will finish the rest by experimenting.
